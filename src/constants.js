  pc: `This is my PC. Most of my time goes into learning and building projects in web development.  
  I mainly use JavaScript and React, and Iâ€™m also exploring backend tech like Express and MongoDB.  
  You can check out my work here on my <a href="https://github.com/SumandeepSahoo" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!`,

  "cs-degree": `I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at KIIT University.  
  It's been an exciting journey so far, full of learning and hands-on projects that push me to grow as a developer.`,

  "sofa-table": `Thatâ€™s my sofa. I usually relax here by watching coding tutorials, tech talks, or sometimes just chilling.  
  A lot of my ideas for projects actually come while Iâ€™m casually browsing tech content online.`,

  tv: `This is my TV. I often follow programming YouTubers and tech creators for inspiration.  
  They motivate me to learn new technologies and improve my coding skills every day.`,

  bed: `This is where I rest, but honestly I often end up brainstorming project ideas here.  
  If something exciting strikes, I make sure to note it down so I can work on it later.`,

  projects: `Info about this portfolio: Itâ€™s built with Kaboom.js, a JavaScript game library that lets you make fun 2D games.  
  Instead of a traditional portfolio, I wanted something creative and interactive.  
  Itâ€™s still a work in progress, but Iâ€™m learning and improving as I go!`,

  library: `These are my books and resources. As a student, Iâ€™m constantly learning from both textbooks and online resources.  
  I may not have read them all fully, but each one adds something new to my understanding of tech.`,

  exit: `If youâ€™d like to exit my portfolio, just close the tab. Thanks for visiting my little 2D world ðŸ™‚`,
